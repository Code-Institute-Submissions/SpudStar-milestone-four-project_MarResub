## A Full Stack Development Project by Edward Stanley
This was meant to be a project showcasing everything I had learnt over this course, however due to conflicting times with university work I was unable to finish the project. Upon contact with the student care team I was advised to at least try and publish something and await resubmission.
The intention for this project was for users to be able to buy and sell 'Pokemon', creatures from the popular pokemon franchise, based on their levels, abilities, stats ect which can vary across pokemon. Users would be able to put their own pokemon up for sale, which when bought would prompt an email to be submitted to the buyer and seller allowing them to communicate to exchange in game. The site would only sort the buying and communication, any trading of pokemon would be done with the buyer and seller.
Users would have their own account to advertise multiple pokemon, and edit their submissions if needs be.

## Testing
One of the main issues I had whilst creating this project was the interactions between clicking on a specific pokemon to bring you to a seperate page where all the information for that pokemon was meant to exist. I was unable to get this to work with the django framework and any external research I did to fix this didnt amount to anything.
Another problem I had was with the AllAuth system initial testing. The system would always skip past the user login step, instead going straight to the success page. Again nothing I found helped alieviate this.

#
## Deployment
I was unable to deploy the project via Heroku, the app refused to connect. Upon attempts to log in via Heroku it would state there was an IP error. I was unable to fix this in time for submission unfortunatley.

## Acknowledgement
I am truely sorry for this poor state of a project, university work completley swept me up and I was unable to complete it. I will have to resubit this project. If I could please get some advice on the code I have done so far, as I struggled with the Django database, that would be wonderful thanks.

Thanks again to the Student Care team who explained to me my options at this time. I unfortunatley, as explained by them, am going to have to arrange a date for resubmission for this project.
